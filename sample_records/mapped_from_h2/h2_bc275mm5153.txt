Abstract
Conservation biologist Luis Zambrano discusses his work in wetland and ecosystem restoration in Mexico City and a rare salamander threatened by development (the Axolotl).  Seriously, if you like looking at cute things, google the Axolotl.  In fact, this rare salamander embodies a particularly powerful cultural symbol, leading to an interesting discussion of the Anthropocene as a cultural boundary. Guest: Luis Zambrano. Interviewer: Michael Osborne. Producers: Michael Osborne, Miles Traer, and Leslie Chang.
